# Video Game Sales Analysis using MySQL
Exploratory data analysis on video game sales.

![pexels-pixabay-163036](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46164783/153789710-556da471-c27f-44d7-a00d-d392d4c6b288.jpg)


## About Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) which contains a list of video games with sales from 1980 to 2020. The dataset has 11 columns and 16598  records. I decided to drop records with null values in order to make the result of the analysis more accurate. In addition, I split the dataset into two related tables based on the principle of data normalization - the "game_info" table contains the basic information of the game, and the "game_sales" table contains the sales records of the game in various regions. 

## Using Temporary Table
Since we will need to join both tables multiple times to perform analysis, I would create a temporary table for resusiblity purpose. Using temporary can make the query a lot shorter and also speed up the runtime to increase efficiency.
``` sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE game_sales_temp
SELECT
    i.game_id,
    name,
    platform,
    year,
    genre,
    publisher,
    na_sales,
    eu_sales,
    jp_sales,
    other_sales,
    global_sales
FROM game_info i
JOIN game_sales s
	ON i.game_id = s.game_id;

SELECT * FROM game_sales_temp;

``` 

Letâ€™s take a look of the completed dataset

###### Denotation of each columns:
- game_id- unique game id
- name - The games name
- platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
- year - Year of the game's release
- genre - Genre of the game
- publisher - Publisher of the game
- na_sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
- eu_sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- jp_sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- other_sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
- global_sales - Total worldwide sales.

## Data Analysis
### 1. Find the top 3 most popular platforms in terms of counts of games.
``` sql
SELECT 
	platform,
    COUNT(name) AS num_games
FROM game_sales_temp
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

    ROUND(SUM(global_sales),2) AS total_sales,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY platform ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(global_sales),2) DESC) AS rank_sales
FROM game_sales_temp
GROUP BY 1,2)
SELECT
	platform,
    genre,
    total_sales
FROM cte
WHERE rank_sales = 1
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

    ROUND((SUM(global_sales)/(SELECT SUM(global_sales) FROM game_sales_completed))*100,2) AS 'sale%'
FROM game_sales_temp
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
